The MathExp project is a collection of tools and utilities for conducting mathematical experiments and research. It is designed to be a flexible and extensible platform for conducting experiments and research in mathematics and related fields. The project is divided into several sub-projects, each of which is designed to be a standalone tool that can be used independently of the others. The sub-projects are:

- maths: A collection of mathematical utilities and tools for conducting experiments and research in mathematics.
- experiments: Runnable applications that use the maths library to demonstrate or explore a specific topic.
